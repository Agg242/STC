 * Coroutine mechanics, implemented on top of standard ANSI C. See
 * https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html for
 * a full discussion of the theory behind this.
 * 
 * To use these macros to define a coroutine, you need to write a
 * function that looks something like this:
 * 
 * 
 * int ascending(cco_handle* ctx) {
 *    cco_context(ctx,
 *      int idx;
 *    );
 *
 *    cco_routine(c,
 *      for (c->idx = 0; c->idx < 10; c->idx += 1)
 *        cco_yield(c->idx);
 *
 *      cco_finish:; // add this to support cco_stop!
 *    );
 *
 *    return -1;
 * }
 * 
 * You declare your persistent variables with the `cco_context'
 * macro. This macro takes the cco_handle as first parameter.
 *
 * Note that the context variable is set back to zero when the
 * coroutine terminates (by cco_stop, or by control reaching
 * finish. This can make the re-entrant coroutines more useful
 * than the static ones, because you can tell when they have
 * finished.
 * 
 * This mechanism could have been better implemented using GNU C
 * and its ability to store pointers to labels, but sadly this is
 * not part of the ANSI C standard and so the mechanism is done by
 * case statements instead. That's why you can't put a cco_yield()
 * inside a switch-statement.
 * 
 * The macros will malloc() the state structure on first call, and
 * free() it when end is reached. If you want to abort in the middle,
 * the caller must call the coroutine with `cco_stop(&ctx)' as
 * parameter instead of &ctx.
 *
 *
 * Ground rules:
 *  - never put `cco_yield' within an explicit `switch'.
 *  - never put two `cco_yield' statements on the same source line.
 *  - add `cco_finish:' label at the end of the coroutine, before
 *    any cleanup code. Required to support cco_stop(ctx) argument.
 *  - in order to stop before all items are consumed, call the
 *    coroutine with `cco_stop(&handle)' as argument at the end.
 * 
 * The caller of a re-entrant coroutine must provide a context
 * variable:
 * 
 * void main(void) {
 *    cco_handle hnd = 0;
 *    for (;;) {
 *       int x = ascending(&hnd);
 *       if (x == 5) cco_stop(&hnd);
 *       if (!hnd) break;
 *       printf("got number %d\n", x);
 *
 *    }
 * }
