     Mersenne Twister random number generator MT19937, 32 bit.
     A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.
     Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
     Optimized by Tyge LÃ¸vset.

     Before using, initialize the state by using mt19937_init(),
     mt19937_seed() or mt19937_default().
